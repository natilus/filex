A Java application written for a project in my COS226 class.

  `$ git clone https://github.com/natilus/filex.git`
3) Navigate to the cloned directory and compile the `.java` files

4) Run the application (be sure to have JavaFX 7 or newer installed)

To be added later. In the meantime, don't use Windows.
